            <p>Hunar is a dynamic eCommerce website that I developed using WordPress as the foundation. 
                It incorporates a meticulously selected plugins and leverages the power of WooCommerce to create
                 a seamless and user-friendly online shopping experience. To ensure secure and convenient payment options,
                 I integrated multiple payment gateways, including bank gateway, PayPal, and Afterpay.</p>
            <img src="img/Hunar-Main page.png">
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
            <p><em>Responsive Design:</em> Hunar boasts a fully responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing 
                experience on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
                 This responsive design enhances user engagement and accessibility.</p>
            <p><em>Development:</em> During the development phase, the conceptualized design and features were transformed into a fully 
                functional and user-friendly online platform. In order to build the architecture and design of the website,
                I tailored the selected WordPress theme to align perfectly with Hunar's unique brand identity and user experience objectives. 
                Elementor played a pivotal role in this process, allowing for flexible and creative customization of the website's layout,
                 structure, and visual elements. <br>
                 For e-commerce functionality WooCommerce was integrated to provide a seamless and feature-rich 
                 online shopping experience. 
                This encompassed product catalogue setup, shopping cart functionality, secure checkout processes, and inventory management.<br>
                For functionality rigorous testing was conducted to ensure all features and functionalities worked as intended, delivering a 
                glitch-free and user-friendly experience.</p>
            <p><em> User Authentication:</em> To simplify the user registration and login process, 
                I integrated Google and Facebook APIs. Users can now easily sign in with their 
                Google or Facebook accounts, reducing friction during their shopping journey.</p>
            <img src="img/Hunar-Login.png">
            <P><em>Payment Gateways:</em> Customers can choose from a variety of payment options, including bank gateway, PayPal, and Afterpay.
                 This diversity allows for a smooth and secure checkout process, increasing customer trust and satisfaction.</P>
            <img src="img/Hunar-Cart.png">
            <p><em>Deploymant Process:</em> I directed the domain name to the host's servers and carefully migrated all the files and databases to ensure a seamless
                 transition. The final step was to integrate security measures and optimize the website's performance.</p>
